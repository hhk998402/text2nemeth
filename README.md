# Text to Nemeth Braille

I have used the following module for implementing the conversion. I have modified the module and the dictionaries slightly to better reflect what I read up on and found as valid Nemeth conversions.

pybrl is an Open-Source Grade-2 Braille Translation system written entirely in Python. It is flexible and any new language can be imported in 10-minutes.

## Run the GUI.py file to test it out
## Pybrl.py contains the conversion codes
